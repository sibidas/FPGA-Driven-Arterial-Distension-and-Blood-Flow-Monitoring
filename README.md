# FPGA-Driven-Arterial-Distension-and-Blood-Flow-Monitoring
A real-time FPGA-based system for monitoring arterial distension and blood flow velocity using Doppler ultrasound signals. The system processes continuous wave (CW) Doppler signals to estimate blood velocity and uses arterial distension data to assess vascular health.
