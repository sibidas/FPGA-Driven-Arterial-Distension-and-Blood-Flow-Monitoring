# FPGA-Driven-Arterial-Distension-and-Blood-Flow-Monitoring
Cardiovascular diseases are on the rise, making early detection and continuous monitoring essential for effective diagnosis and management. This work presents the design of an FPGA-based system for real-time arterial distension and blood flow monitoring using ultrasound techniques. By integrating Support Vecto Machine (SVM)-based pattern recognition with advanced signal processing methods, the system accurately measures arterial diameter changes (for distension monitoring) and estimates blood flow velocity in real time. Leveraging the high-speed processing and reconfigurability of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), the design is optimized for portable and real-time medical diagnostics. Key features include Time-Gain Compensation (TGC) for echo signal enhancement, an SVM classifier for arterial wall pattern recognition, and an automatic range-gate positioning scheme for dynamic depth adjustment, ensuring precise and focused analysis of both arterial distension and blood flow.The system employs a Finite State Machine (FSM) to coordinate essential operations such as probe stabilization, range-gate adjustment, signal processing,arterial diameter measurement, and Doppler frequency analysis. For blood flow
monitoring, the system isolates Doppler-shifted echo signals and uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to extract the Doppler frequency shift, enabling real-time velocity estimation. Designed for implementation on an Artix-7 FPGA, the system is expected to handle computationally intensive tasks while addressing challenges such as noise, signal attenuation, and probe misalignment. With proposed techniques like hysteresis-based comparators and advanced filtering, the system aims to ensure reliable and accurate performance for both arterial distension and blood flow monitoring
